# Hyprland Virtual Desktop Manager 

## Description

Hyprland Virtual Desktop Manager is a command-line interface (CLI) tool 
designed to enhance and extend the capabilities of the existing 
[hyprctl](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Using-hyprctl/) 
utility provided by [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org). This application 
aims to deliver improved functionality for users with multi-monitor 
Hyprland setups. 

During the process of configuring my own Hyprland environment, I found 
it necessary to create numerous scripts to achieve the level of virtual 
desktop management I required. To streamline this experience and provide 
a more robust solution, I consolidated these scripts and rewrote them in 
Rust, resulting in a comprehensive tool for efficient virtual desktop 
management on Hyprland.
